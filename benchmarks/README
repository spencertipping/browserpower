This is a series of microbenchmarks to determine how efficient V8 is relative
to C++. Normally I would rely on the Benchmarks game [1] for such things, but
it imposes various rules such as disallowing loop unrolling. I'm willing to
consider manually unrolling loops if I can get decent performance from the
browser.

Most likely this directory will be of little interest to most people.
