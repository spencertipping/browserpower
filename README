BrowserPower is a simple framework for browser-powered map/reduce jobs.

To use, first run the server:
$ node server.js

Then open two browser windows. Point one at localhost:8080 -- this is a worker
node. Point the other at localhost:8080/admin -- this is the driver interface.
You can submit jobs by tweaking the functions in the admin interface and using
the Run button. You can also connect as many clients as you want as workers;
jobs are parallelized automatically between them.
